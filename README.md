# knapsackProblem
The main function is `solve_problem()` in `main.py` in which You can configure each parameter.

Output:
- optimus solution for this problem (from answers)
- final score on the last iteration (not always the best throughout all iterations)
- best scores for each individual iteration plus score just after creating population (at index 0).

Algorithm satisfy criteria up to 3.5 grade, but currently needs optimization for large-scale
